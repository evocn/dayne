The story of umi, revised.

# Notes
---

We need Takeda to be reluctant, for him to refuse his destiny all the way.
We need a strong-willed brother to try to take it all the way. To push the envelope.
Takeda's father needs to be part of the story. Ojii - can't really cut it.

There has to be the real stuff. Seppuku, Families, Honor.

We can't really tell the story in the format we're doing it in.
How do we take advantage of the medium?
What can it add?

I have to convince myself that this would be better off as a game than as a book or a film.
That's the hard part.

But what's the real trouble with that?
Games have something to say here.

Takeda's story:

Satisfaction vs. Ambition

Why does Michael keep going?
Is it fear which drives him?
Is it solely that enemy which tears his life apart?
Or is it something deeper? Some great respect for his father, maybe?
Could it be destiny?

Why would I do it? Take a risk?
For me, it's a fear of slowly dying. Of never really doing what I desired.
In pursuit of that, I will even invent things to believe in.
It's a narrow dissatisfaction with what life offers me otherwise.

I love a story like the Godfather because it gives a guy like me a chance. Some
reason that might be a little better than mine.
Maybe not better, but at least not so god damn childish, insincere.

The Way of the Murakami
=======================
Just as the sea is bound by tides, so too is the world of man.
And just as soon as the waves of the ocean rise, so too will they come crashing
down, and recede back to whence they came.

Family Tree
===========
Takeshi Murakami
> Akira
> Keiko
> Takeda
* Kawahime
  > Akihito

- Kame
- Haruhachi

Characters
========================
Takeshi
-------
The father of the Murakami. The great lord.
He rose from nothing to become a face in the Seto.

Akira
-----
The heir to the Murakami.
Strong-willed. Loyal. Scrappy. A real Sonny.
His ambitions get the best of him.

Keiko
-----
A quiet, ruthless Murakami.
Not involved in the wartime racketeering, Keiko keeps to herself.
But she controls Aki from the shadows.

Kawahime
--------
The River Princess.
Daughter of the Mori clan.
An outsider to the family business.
Enjoys life for its own sake. Has an unshakeable faith in the good of the world.

SHIFT | Trust -> Distrust -> ???

Takeda
------
The prodigal son.
Initially wants nothing to do with the family business. Wants to fight for unification.

He becomes a war hero, but he is called back to the family when Takeshi falls ill.
In his father and brothers' stead, he becomes the head of the family, and carries them through the battles to come.

He grows more powerful, and continually accumulates enemies while killing old ones.
He loses the idealism of his youth, using dishonest methods to kill his foes, and discarding the dreams he once held.
Eventually, he reaches supercritical mass, and must face the consequences of what he has done.

He will lose everything. His daughter, his son, his wife, his family.
He will not have any control. But in truth, he will have been able to avert his course at every turn.
He will be the man apart by the end. The king.

SHIFT | Satisfaction -> Ambition -> ???
SHIFT | Free Will -> Responsibility -> Destiny

Kame
----
Takeda's Uncle.
A quiet force for good in the story.
A believer in older ways. An advocate for peace.

Haruhachi
---------
> Appears in the second act.
> Seems loyal to the family, but betrays them to Mori Motonari.

TODO
====
* Sometime in early Act II, Kawahime gives birth to another child, a girl this time.
  * I don't think we need to detail this, but it might be important... idk
* Kaze should be more of a character?
* Maybe there needs to be another brother, someone who is more fun-loving, who
  could get killed by Takeda's negligent actions? Something to really bring the
  guilt on thick. We are already doing this with his kids, but I tend to think
  it's not nearly as effective with the kids. Since you don't really get to
  connect with them on a personal level.
* Should we write this like a novel? And just put the chapters inbetween the
  fights?

Act I
=====
Scene - | Exposition
--------------------
> The year is 1555.
Takeshi Murakami is the head of the powerful Murakami family - a crime syndicate which controls more resources than any Daimyo in southern Japan, but owns and
> operates from only three small islands in the vast inland ocean.

Scene I | The Stars
-------------------
> Sunset. Golden rays beat down on an orange evening. Mount Fuji looms.
> Takeshi sits in a fishing boat with his son, Takeda.

Takeshi
    My son, look upon the sky. Twilight comes across the hills. For many,
    this bears an invitation to sleep. But look there. For those of us who brave
    the dark of the night, the stars beckon us.

    For every man, there is a star. I have found mine. Now I wonder, Takeda. What
    will your star be?

> Takeda watches the stars, wondering at them as night falls.


Scene II | The Murakami Navy
----------------------------
> The study of Takeshi. Two-dozen Murakami men sit cross-legged along the sides
> of the candlelit room. It is a warm evening. It is a war council.
> Kame lays out the plans for battle. It is a betrayal of the Ouchi clan.

Kame
    The plan is a simple entrapment. When the tides flow East, we squeeze.

    There is no need for casualties. We have certain guarantees here.
    The Ouchi will not know of this.

> Kame's expression bears no remorse, just a stolid, stone frown, like so many
> other men hardened after a lifetime of risk and loss.
> Takeshi looks upon his men with care. He addresses each of them by name and
> bestows upon them a gift.

Takeshi
    Akira, you are ready now to sail at my side.
    You will assist me at our warship. 
    You will see your future with your own eyes.

## <Fight I> | The Glory Days
A fight between the powerful Murakami Navy and the unprepared Ouchi.
A bloodbath. A testament to the strategic genius of Takeshi Murakami.

> The plan works. Victory is won. Akira becomes Takeshi's second admiral.

Scene III | The Celebration
-----------------------
> It is the wedding of Akira and Kiyo.
> Takeshi is an aged man now. The family business slows down. Things settle into
> a peace. The Murakami are happy.

> Amidst the celebrations, Takeda takes his leave of the family.
> He leaves with a note to his father, about leaving to find his own star.

## <Fight II> | The Admiral
A fight between Oda Nobunaga's forces, led at sea by the young prodigy Takeda
Murakami. His ragtag bunch of ships pull off an upset at Ouchi bay, and assure
Oda Nobunaga's ability to ascend to the Shogunate.

> For his victory, he is offered land under the Oda shogunate. He seems poised
> to continue his loyalty as the Oda clan's main naval admiral.

Scene IV | The Journey
------------------
> Takeda has been fighting under the Oda banner for four years now.
> He has earned the trust of many generals. He has saved a great many lives.
> He commands a small navy. He serves the shogun.

> Takeda's friend and lieutenant Kuki Yoshitaka informs Takeda of a strange
> rumor.
> He says that the Murakami clan is making a great many enemies in the Seto Sea,
> and that they will be cracked down on under the shogun.

> After deliberation, Takeda resigns from his post, and deserts
> the military. He sets off for Noshima castle.

> He travels a great distance, recounting the tale of how he arrived at the Oda
> clan all the while.

Scene V | The Romance
---------------------
> While staying a night in a small village on the Koto, he meets a woman. Her
> name is Kawahime, lady of the river.
> He spends one week with her, then leaves towards his responsibilities.

Takeda
    Lady of the river, and of the stars above, remember me.
    I will return for you as soon as my fate allows, and as soon as my family
    has come right round. I will long for you until that day, and pray that it
    might come sooner.

Scene VI | The Return
----------------
> Takeda returns to the Murakami family under a still morning.
> He is greeted by Akira's navy, which nearly sink his paddleboat.

> Akira greets him with a complicated mix of joy and distrust, along with some
> long-held resentment.

Akira
    Takeda, you were away so long, many had thought you dead. Only those who
    knew you had faith that you could not have been slayed on the road like an
    animal. We know you have father's strength in you, and that nothing would
    stay your course.

    In any case, you've been away a long while. Many things have changed.

    Father is too old to command the navy. He still makes the decisions, but I
    am left to most of the governance.

    And one more thing...
    Mother is dead.
    It was soon after you left. She died peacefully.
    I can take you to her grave when we reach Noshima.

    First, I must take you to father. He sleeps quite early these days.
    Ah, and Keiko... She'll be thrilled to see you.

    Takeda... I'm glad to have you back.

> Takeda reunites with his family. He speaks little of his time in the war.
> He seeks only to help Akira, to comfort Keiko. To spend time with his father.
> He has a newfound love for his family.

Scene VII | The War
------------------
> Another war council. Takeshi is bed-bound, so Akira stands before Kame and the
> rest. Takeda sits among them.

Akira
    The great houses have resisted our tithes. None have declared war, but we
    are on the brink with a great many.
    The Murakami cannot exist in a climate like this.

    The first to fight will most likely be the Mori clan.
    Brother... If we fight the Mori, it will not by any means be a guarantee.
    It will be a coin flip. It is not the kind of fight to start lightly.

> Takeda considers the condition of the Murakami.
> After plenty of thought, and a personal discussion with his father, he decides
> to help.

> He offers the arquebus which he retained from his military service, and the
> Murakami use it to construct a number of gunpowder-firing weapons.
> He offers Akira his leadership among the waves. He will be his lieutenant.
> They prepare for war with the Mori.

## <Fight III> | The Coin Flip
A positional fight between the Murakami, led by the two-headed forces of Akira
and Takeda, against the overwhelming wealth and might of the Mori clan.
One by one, the Murakami take apart the Mori war machine, and claim victory
through adversity.

> The Murakami are victorious. A flat-out victory, in honorable fashion.
> Takeshi is proud. He sees his boys as the true fulfillment of the Murakami legacy.
> The Murakami have re-established their dominance in the inland sea.
> Mori Motonari begins to scheme a more elaborate solution to the Murakami problem.

Scene VIII | The Calm
--------------------
> In the months following the battle with the Mori, the Murakami gain influence.
> Akira and Takeda, side by side, gain glory and wealth for the Murakami through
> various industries.
> Akira and his wife have two children.
> Takeda spends many days just sitting with his father, and with Kame. They
> don't talk much, but every now and again, they will tell him of the good old
> days.

> On a calm evening in the summer, he discusses with Akira the future of the family.

Takeda
    Akira, this business we find ourselves in... It is not of the long-lasting sort.
    An empire which sustains itself on crime will find itself with an unlimited
    supply of enemies, and they will sustain long after the wealth has ceased.

    I will not ask that you undo the work which our father put his heart and
    soul into, for all of our sakes.
    I merely ask that you remain prudent, and do not forget the Way of the
    Murakami.

Scene IX | The Departure
--------------------------
> Takeda receives word from the village he visited half a year prior. Kawahime is pregnant.
> He declares to Akira that he must go to her.
> His father understands. He smiles upon Takeda. He mentions how this is his
> star. He tells him he's proud of his decision to fight for unification.

> Takeda leaves the Murakami family once more, promising his return within the
> year. It will have already been too late.

Scene X | The Reunion
----------------------
> Takeda, now a traveler once more, is reunited with Kawahime.
> They live for six months together, and are married before the child is born.
> In the spring, the child is born. It is a boy.

Scene XI | The Storm
-------------------
> Assassins within the Murakami family, working for the Mori and Ouchi clans,
> successfully murder Akira and many other Murakami. Kame is gravely injured,
> but survives.

> Takeshi mourns the loss of his son, along with his wife.

> Akira's murder leaves the Murakami family without an able-bodied heir, so
> Takeshi takes charge once again, with Kame at his side.
> They prepare for another war.

## <Fight IV> | The Echo
Takeshi's last stand at sea. He defends the castle from pirates as the
Murakami's head once more. He utilizes all of the might of the Murakami, and the
castle still falls to ruin.

> The remnants of the Murakami just barely manage to hold off the enemy forces,
> and the rest remain only to mourn the dead.

Scene XII | The Return
---------------------
> Takeda returns to Noshima castle with Kawahime and his son, oblivious to the
> events that transpired.
> He finds the island in ruins, and the remaining Murakami disorganized. He
> learns of Akira's death.
> He takes the blame fully onto himself.
> He nearly commits seppuku for his insolence, but his son, in his innocence,
> stops him.

Scene XIII | The Decision
------------------------
> Takeshi and Takeda sit atop a knoll, watching the waves of the sea. It is a
> beautiful summer day.
> Takeshi tells Takeda of his newfound humility. Of his fear for battle.
> But he also speaks of how he wishes Takeda could chart his own course. How he
> believes his family could be a fresh start.
> Takeda does not hear his sentiment. He wants to help his family. His guilt is
> too much.

> He agrees to lead the Murakami family.

> He tells Kawahime, but this puts a stake between them.
> From here on, Takeda is alone.

Act II
======
Scene XIV | The Wisdom
--------------------
> A flashback to a time when Takeshi told Takeda of the central principles of
> leadership. Of the keys to Takeshi's life. He is an old man now.
> He forgets things sometimes.
> Takeda refers to Takeshi as "pop"

## <Fight V> | The Second War
A fight between a few forces.
We want to introduce the principal villains of this act here.
Mori should be involved, but not Motonari.
Ouchi leader should be involved.
Oda leader should be involved.
Perhaps also the pirates?

> Victory is won, and the Murakami have finally found their way out of the
> woods.
> For a moment, Takeda can finally return home.

Scene XV | The Rememberance
---------------------------
> Three years have passed.
> The Murakami fight battle after battle.
> Takeda leads the Murakami as a warlord.

> They try to retain their footholds in the criminal industries of the mainland.
> Takeda does not believe in this business. He does not approve of it.
> But it is all he can do to keep the Murakami afloat.

Cut to Takeda at the gravesite of his family.
> He mourns the loss of his father.
> His mother talks with him.
> Kame becomes his closest advisor.

Scene XVI | The Wedding
-----------------------
> Keiko is wed to another Murakami.

> We introduce Haruhachi, head of the Innoshima Murakami.
> He is loud, boisterous, and pledges his support to the Noshima in their time
> of need.
> His business is women, which is reprehensible to Takeda, but he keeps this
> information from his wife Kawahime. This drives them further apart.

> We are introduced to the Captain of the Ninja, Kaze. He pledges his loyalty to
> the Murakami clan.

> Takeda and Kame seem to have some secret plan. They speak only when alone.

> Takeda prepares for wartime once more.

## <Fight VI> | The Offensive
The Murakami navy, bolstered by the artillery of the Innoshima, sets forth to
take on the militia of the Ouchi.
The battle is difficult until a land assault by the Mori turns the tide.
An alliance with the Mori clan is unheard of, and only Takeda seems to have
known about it.

> Total victory over the Ouchi gives the Murakami confidence in the Ise Bay.
> However, the alliance with the Mori is uncertain. What could Takeda be planning?

Scene XVII | The Meeting
----------------------
> Takeda travels into Mori territory to meet with Motonari.
> He feigns ignorance of Mori's plot to assassinate his brother, Akira, and
> offers to assist with Mori's ascension to take on Oda Nobunaga.

> Mori is also angling here, but he is oblivious to Takeda's knowledge.
> Takeda plans to kill Mori, but he will wait until the moment is right.

## <Fight VII> | The Tower
A great big fight. On one side, the Murakami, allied with the Mori. On the
other, Takeda's old navy, commanded by his old friend Kuki Yoshitaka, and the
forces of Oda Nobunaga. One side will have control of Ishiyama Hongan-ji by the
end of the fight.

> The fight is eventually victorious, with heavy casualties.
> The Mori are given the castle, and the Murakami reap the spoils of war.
> A subtly tense exchange between Mori and Takeda throws a bit of doubt into
> Takeda's plans - had Motonari found him out?

Scene XVIII | The Stars II
------------------------
> Takeda brings his son to the top of the great tower of stone.
> He shows his son all that he can achieve here.

> Kawahime offers to Takeda that he can stop now.
> Takeda tells her that he cannot stop now - that he can guarantee their safety
> and freedom if he just does one last deed.

> He tells her he is doing it all for the safety of their family. For their
> children. For Akihito.

Scene XIX | The Funeral
------------------------
> Takeshi's wife dies.
> Takeda meets with Kaze and Kame on the funeral day. Plans.
> Kawahime notices this.

Scene XX | The Night
----------------------
> Takeda orders the murders of half a dozen daimyo around the Seto sea.
> His goal is to eliminate all enemies of the Murakami family, and do so without
> a trace.
> The Ouchi, Miyoshi, and Azai clan leaders are all killed. Additionally, Kuki
> Yoshitaka is killed, but his lord Oda Nobunaga survives. Finally, Mori
> Motonari survives.

> Takeda learns of much of this information piecemeal, and begins to distrust
> his close advisors.

> In fear, he decides to leave to the open sea.
> He flees Noshima castle with his family and a few ships just as a secret
> assault detonates most of the Murakami fleet. The Mori were prepared for
> Takeda's move.

> In the assault, Keiko is killed, along with most of the 

Scene XXI | The Traitor
-------------------------
> The remaining Murakami scramble towards Innoshima, where they hope to seek
> refuge and find help against Mori.

> When they arrive, Haruhachi seems glad to see them. He offers to keep the
> family safe on Innoshima until they can mount an offensive against the Mori.

> In truth, Haruhachi is operating for the Mori now.
> He waits until Takeda is relaxed, then abducts his children. He kills his
> daughter.

> Takeda and Kawahime escape to their ships, but must cross through Mori and
> Innoshima lines to make it to safety. They have very slim odds.

## <Fight VIII> | The Escape
A different sort of fight - the goal is to survive. You are behind enemy lines,
and must try to get as many troops across the line as you can.

> The remains of the Murakami trawl their way across the waves towards the open
> sea. They elude their pursuers, but their few ships cannot provide much
> promise.
> Takeda and Kawahime mourn their lost children.

Act III
=======
Scene XXII | The New Age
------------------------
> Oda Nobunaga has been assassinated by his retainer.
> Japan falls into disorder once more. Hideyoshi continues where Oda left off.
> Ishiyama Hongan-ji has long been taken.

(Essentially, a great number of years pass here, and we should use history to
give that feeling of time passing.)

> Mori Motonari has lost much of his power. He retains only the lands which
> Hideyoshi has not yet conquered.

Scene XXIII | The Elderly Couple
--------------------------------
> It has been a great many years. Takeda and Kawahime, childless, have lived in
> hiding near Kyoto.
> It has been a quiet life, a life of great remorse.
> They have everything which they wanted in their youth, but none of the means
> by which to enjoy it.

> Takeda, elderly, sits in front of Kame's gravestone, with Kawahime beside him.
> A quiet, slow rainfall begins rolling in.

Takeda
    It will be tonight.
    Then the journey will be at an end.

Scene XXIV | The Family Reunion
-------------------------------
> A quiet, rainy street on a November midnight.
> A dozen or so hooded figures make their way through the city streets.
> Each carries a weapon at their side.
> They travel by shadow. None are seen.
> They converge at the docks. They board ships made for transport.
> They haul anchor and set to oars. They row silently.

> Once the silent caravan has made their way beyond the view of the city,
> A breath of calm comes over the ship.
> Hoods are drawn. The folk make themselves known to eachother at last.
> The last of the Murakami greet eachother at long last.

Scene XXV | The Return II
---------------------------
> The Murakami, riding atop a mere four boats, chart a course for Noshima
> castle.

> When they arrive, they find the place in ruins. At one point, bandits must
> have come and taken everything of value from the island.

> Takeda kneels once more at the graves of his family, and cleans their
> tombstones.

> The Murakami mourn their past one last time, and head onward towards their
> final destination.

## <Fight IX> | The Finale
A fight with the remnants of the Mori clan.
Motonari is long dead.
The Mori are in shambles as well.

It is revenge in spirit only.

Scene XXVII | The Epilogue
------------------------
Takeda and Kawahime watch the setting sun from a knoll on Noshima Island.
They do not have anything to say.
They die soon after.
