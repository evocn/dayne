## The year is 1555.

Takeshi Murakami is the head of the powerful Murakami family -
a family more powerful than any Daimyo in southern Japan,
which occupies only three small islands in the Seto Sea.

The home of the Murakami is Noshima Island.
An island of a seafaring people which once were mere fishermen.
It is less than a mile across.

Our story begins here.
Twenty-five years later, it ends here, too - 
for in twenty-five years, the Murakami family, 
scourge of the seto,
masters of the sea,
will be no more.
