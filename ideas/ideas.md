Had some big ideas for this engine, and what I want to do with it...

The so-called "Role-Playing Game" is a fresh, new idea.
It is the strongest premise I have ever found.

A simple game of decision-making.
* A basic vignette is laid out.
* A decision is made.
* The results are illuminated.
That is all.

It's quite elegant, and it can mean a lot, given the right circumstances.

I envision the first of these to be about 10 minutes to play through.

## Italy Anno 1200
    The first setting I envisioned was that of Italy in the middle ages.
    An old knight, exiled from his house, bereft of his land, and outlived of his family.
    He journeys across an increasingly strange land - a land of change, modernization, yes,
    but also still the land of lawlessness from his youth.

    It's like La Strada but about 800 years earlier.

    Now imagine this game, with a classical score, with some branching choices, with life-or-death scenarios.
    With honest human feeling. With the alienation of such an older time, expressed in an unknown world.

    It's sweet, and contains all that an Italy game should.

## New England Anno 1850
    The temptation to do a Moby Dick game grows by the day.
    
    Imagine decisions as a sailor in these times.
    With all the grog, tobacco, destitution, quiet austerity, whore-houses, and religiosity that comes with that archetype.

    It's incredibly potent, and with a soundtrack of shanties, art inspired by the Golden Age of Sail, and
    some character with whom personal feelings can be shared, this is pretty promising.

    Again, 10 minutes sounds right for this experience.

## Umi
    Now that we've stripped the thing of its tactical significance,
    Umi turns out to be a pretty promising version of this game.

    We have all the art already, and we can do a more VN-style presentation.

    We still want this to be short, and the writing would have to be really good, since it's mostly dialogue,
    but I think this has potential now.
