# Systems
## Vignettes
The game presents small scenarios for the player, in sequence.
Each vignette will have some narrative / description, a little bit of conversation if any is apparent, then a choice.
Each scenario may or may not provide the player with a choice to make.
These choices, informed by the knight's attributes, result in different outcomes, attribute changes, or nothing, depending on the context.
Most choices are mostly inconsequential, but some are crucial. This is by design.

## Attributes
The governing aspects of a character's personality.

The Attributes are:
* Emotion (Tenderness, Nostalgia, Joy.)
* Clarity (Emptiness, Wisdom, Non-attachment.)
* Passion (an individual's drive to act.)
* Focus   (Perception, Fighting, Physical stuff.)
* Maybe? Unity   (being well-aligned in all aspects.)

Examples:
> Camp is set, fire is burning, and the night is still. 
> You claim a bit of time before you sleep.
> What do you do?
    * Watch the stars.  (Emotion)
    * Meditate.         (Clarity)
    * Sharpen blade.    (Focus)


Alternative Ideas:
I like Ultima 4's stats. Those are cool. Here they are, for reference:
* Honesty       (Truth)
* Compassion    (Love)
* Valor         (Courage)
* Justice       (Truth & Love)
* Sacrifice     (Love & Courage)
* Honor         (Courage & Truth)
* Spirituality  (Truth, Love, & Courage)
* Humility      (Considered the root of all virtues)

Attributes are not exposed directly to the player. Illusions are key with this design.

## Branching Paths
Some portions of the story will be branches, meaning that a player might make a decision that puts them into a part of the story which they wouldn't be on otherwise.
It will be clear to the player when these decisions are presented.
Alternatively, some branches are unknown, and might lead to some interesting secret paths.
