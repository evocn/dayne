This is an outline of the types of vignettes I want to have in the game, and a little bit of thought into how they connect.

# Vignettes
## Camping
* Sharpen your blade
* Still your mind
* Think of the past

## The City
* Purchase supplies
* Make conversation with the locals
* Play games with the local children
* Look for work

## Road House
* 

## Slavers on the road

## Lone Squire

## Mercenaries

## The Lady in the Lake

## The Oracle

## The Burning Shack

## The Deserter

## The Dying Man

## The Gossiper

## The Exile

## 

# Narrative
A few thoughts here, TODO of course:

We want to have some overarching narrative aspects, like the following:
* A Squire whose knight has died. You can choose to take him on. He is your responsibility from then on.
* An exiled prostitute, who you can choose to escort to another city.
* A Prince deposed, with a claim to the crown. You can choose to support him, or continue as a lone knight.

Or something more light-touch, like:
* You want to see the ocean, one last time. It's a long journey, but you know the way.
* There's a tournament in Pest in three months. You want to compete.
* You're a wanderer, until purpose strikes you.
