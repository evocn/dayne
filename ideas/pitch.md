V0.2 Pitch
Sword

This is a pitch for this conception of the Sword Game.
I'm calling this version of the idea V0.2.

# Elevator Pitch

# Inspirations
The Oregon Trail
* Distinctive choices
* Management of human being in an arduous scenario.
  * The mechanics are relatable, and yet foreign. You're not doing jumps and stuff, but rather trying to stay warm, happy, and safe from harm.
* Risk vs. Reward... This element might be less focused on in our game.
  It's ultimately shallower than personal choice, and so is the first thing to cut.

Light Narrative Elements
* Characters who change over time. Their opinions, fears, beliefs... This makes it relatable.
* Narratives have been surprisingly well-expressed in this medium in certain cases.
  Since my focus has always been narrative, I think we could pull it off.

Medieval European Setting
* The Fantasy of being a Knight, put through a clear and mostly unbiased lens.
* The world of Medieval Europe is incredible, and many of the games which explore it are shallow or overly complex.
* World is explored, not explained. Like Dark Souls, or Princess Mononoke.
  * The mystery inherent in a historical setting is so potent, we don't even need to indulge in fantasy.

Classical Score
* The greatest works of music in history are at our fingertips.
  Cultivating and curating a fine soundtrack will provide a unique experience to many players.

Evocative Artwork
* The murals in Crusader Kings III are better than the game itself. So evocative!

# Scope
## Anticipated timeline:
6 Months to prototype. Timeline puts that around December.
Alex: 400 hours. 10-20 hours per week. (15 hours * 26 weeks = 390 hours)
Artist: ???
## Personnel
1 Developer / Designer / Writer
1 Artist / Writer
Potentially more artists post-prototype.

## Tricky pieces of work
Vignettes themselves should be a piece of cake. UI Code is easy, making the system dynamic might take a week but not longer.

Light elements of management, like the menus in Morrowind or Firewatch mechanics.
* This will take some time to iron out, and might be partially formed until later in prototype development.
* These won't be mundane things like money or hunger. We assume the knight can manage his own life there.
* This is stuff like how he feels, what his priorities are. How honed he is for combat, vs. his spiritual strength.
* Light systems for character change based on decisions. I want there to be a little bit of nuance to this, and this will probably require the most nuance of anything.
  We can go like Chris Crawford, or Josh Sawyer, or some mix of others. Lots of inspirations here.

Branching paths at a few set points.
* Mostly the fights. We want some climactic moments to lead to different outcomes.
* We frame this all as travelling. So if you choose to save the squire in a fight, maybe you choose to travel with him to his home. If you instead choose to save the damsel,
* you might fall in love with her and escort her to another place.
* Very light touch stuff, since they're all vignettes anyways, but might change the scenery, and the long-term story a good bit.

Fights are not really fights.
* I want them to feel out of the player's control. All the player can do is decide whether or not to draw their sword, whether or not to let the captive die, etc.

Polish in the prototype is important for this sort of thing.
* Le Morte De Arthur falls flat, since Chris Crawford isn't a writer or an artist.
  We can't have these elements in place early on, but we can get some good inspiration going, through music and concept art, and discovering good literature.

Those are the systems. Most of the work will be writing, creation of vignettes, and art.
